<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I'm unpredictable in the most predictable way possible! 
    Okay, let me explain...if you ask me a personal question, just think of the opposite of what you initally thought I would say, and bam! 
    You got me! lol For example, when you get a group of people together they are bound to talk about television shows, well, I don't really watch television.
    My most common responses are "Really?" "Why?" or just a simply, a quiet nod. I'm used to it. 
    Although I have made a point to watch television shows my bosses enjoy. 
    Sometimes it's just easier to go with the flow!</p>


<p>Have you ever seen those license plates that say "I would rather be..."? 
    Well, if I was to ever overcome my fear of public humiliation, and force my inner most thoughts unto the world, mine would say "I would rather be doing exactly what I didn't do today". 
    See, even my license plate quote is unpredictable in the most predictable way possible. 
    Let me explain what I mean when I say I would rather be doing what I didn't today. 
    I over plan, if I were to ever share my process, which I wouldn't because according to Shark Tank (an old boss was a fan ;-) a patent is required before we share anything these days, but if I did, you would find very organized notes, spreadsheets filled with analytical data and beautiful charts campairing the most minute details.
    Then you would see me check my watch and proceed with my day as previously scheduled. </p>

<p> I don't want to give you the wrong impression. 
    My well thought out plans have absolutely no correlation to the "head first" vocational experiences that randomly appear and exit my very structured timeline of life.
